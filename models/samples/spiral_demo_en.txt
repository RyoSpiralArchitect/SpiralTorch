SpiralTorch demo text (English)

SpiralTorch is an experiment in building a “learning stack” that stays simple:
tiny runnable examples, portable backends, and a geometry-first view of training.

We are not trying to win a benchmark today. We want a loop that you can read,
modify, and rerun in minutes. When you change one idea, you should be able to
see the effect immediately.

The coherence-wave character model is intentionally small. It trains directly
from raw text without tokenization. The goal is to explore how Z-space style
updates and resonance-style modules behave in practice.

Try changing the prompt, the window size, the dilations, or the infusion mode.
Does a separate “infuse step” feel different from blending infusion into the
loss update? Can the model keep a consistent tone when the training data is
short and noisy?

If you are reading this, the demo is working. Now replace this file with your
own notes, a log, or a small corpus and see what it learns.
