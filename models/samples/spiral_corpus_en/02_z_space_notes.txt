Z-space notes

The z-space idea (in this repo) is:
- keep representations continuous and geometric
- keep training loops small enough to audit
- keep the model usable even when the loss curve is not impressive

Sometimes the sample quality improves before the loss visibly drops,
especially on tiny corpora. Track both.
