SpiralTorch demo corpus (English)

SpiralTorch is an experiment in a "learning stack":
- tiny runnable models
- one-command training loops
- optional GPU backends (WGPU, CUDA/HIP when available)

This file is intentionally small and plain-text so you can fine-tune quickly.
If you want a bigger dataset, add more .txt files to this folder and pass the
folder path into the script.
