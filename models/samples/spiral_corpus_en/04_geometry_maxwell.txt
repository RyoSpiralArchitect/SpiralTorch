Geometry + Maxwell

Geometry is a first-class citizen here:
curvature, constraints, and "desire" can be treated as signals.

Maxwell-style flows can be used as a bridge:
from narrative hints -> field-like updates -> stable adaptation.

This is not a claim of correctness; it is a playground for ideas.
