# Security Policy

We take SpiralTorch's safety seriously. If you discover a security issue,
please contact maintainers privately before disclosing it.

## Supported Versions

SpiralTorch is currently pre-release software. Security fixes are developed on
the `main` branch and will be included in the next tagged release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email: kishkavsesvit@icloud.com

Please include:

- A detailed description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
- Suggested mitigations if available.

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and keep you informed as we work on
a resolution. Once a fix is available we will coordinate a disclosure timeline
with you.

## Verifying Official Builds

To detect malicious mirrors or unauthorized resellers, every GitHub release now
ships with:

- Signed wheels built in GitHub Actions with SLSA provenance attestations.
- `CHECKSUMS.sha256`, `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`, and `SBOM.json` generated by the
  release workflow and signed with Sigstore.
- `VERIFYING.md` instructions detailing how to validate the above artifacts.

Validate the signatures and checksums before installing a build. Treat any
distribution missing these files—or failing verification—as untrusted and
notify the maintainers immediately.
