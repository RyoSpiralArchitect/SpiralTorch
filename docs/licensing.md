# Licensing

SpiralTorch is available under a dual-license model designed to support both the open-source community and commercial adopters.

## Open-Source License: AGPL-3.0-or-later

SpiralTorch’s default license is **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later (AGPL-3.0-or-later)**. Key points:

- You may use, modify, and redistribute the software, provided that your modifications are also distributed under the AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- The AGPL’s network-use clause applies. If you make SpiralTorch available to users over a network (e.g., SaaS, hosted APIs, inference services), you must provide those users with access to the corresponding source code.
- Contributions to SpiralTorch remain licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later unless a separate Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is executed.
- The license keeps Z-space hypergrad experiments, WGPU prototypes, and production deployments open and transparent for the broader community.

The full text of the license ships in [`LICENSE .txt`](../LICENSE%20.txt).

## Commercial License

Organizations that require more flexibility than the AGPL provides—such as private SaaS deployments, closed-source internal tooling, or proprietary feature development—can obtain a commercial license. This option grants:

- The ability to use, modify, and distribute SpiralTorch without the copyleft obligations of the AGPL.
- Protection for proprietary IP, including the ability to keep downstream modifications private.
- Access to priority support, roadmap input, and optional custom engineering engagements.

### Pricing Tiers (Annual Subscription, Billed Yearly)

- **Individual / Small Team (1–5 users):** $500–$2,000. Ideal for indie developers prototyping Canvas Transformers or Z-space models. Includes basic support.
- **Startup / SME (5–50 users):** $2,000–$10,000. Scales by seats or devices (e.g., $0.50–$2 per user per month). Tailored for distributed training campaigns with GoldenRetriever and similar stacks.
- **Enterprise (50+ users, Custom Deployments):** $10,000+. Pricing can incorporate per-instance fees ($2–$5) for large fleets. Comes with indemnity, custom Z-space tuning, and 24/7 support coverage.

> **Launch Offer:** Early adopters receive a 50% discount on the first year of any commercial tier.

All commercial tiers unlock premium capabilities such as advanced telemetry dashboards and forthcoming fractional FFT extensions.
