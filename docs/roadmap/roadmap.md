# SpiralTorch Strategic Roadmap

_Last updated: 2024-06-XX_

## 1. Major Milestones

| Phase | Target Window | Exit Criteria | Owners | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proof of Concept (PoC) Completion | Q3 FY24 | • FFI bindings for top 3 kernels demoed in Python & Rust<br>• Baseline benchmarking harness operational<br>• Stakeholder sign-off on architectural assumptions | Applied Research, Platform | Validate technical feasibility and integration path.
| Performance Validation | Q4 FY24 | • Throughput ≥ +35% vs. current CUDA baseline on reference workloads<br>• Stability tests >72h without regressions<br>• Ops readiness review passed | Performance Eng, QA | Focus on sustained throughput and regression coverage.
| Production Rollout | Q1 FY25 | • CI pipelines updated and cost controls configured<br>• On-call runbooks finalized<br>• Launch approval from Product & Ops councils | Platform, SRE, Product | Gradual canary release with rollback criteria defined.
| Developer Enablement | Q2 FY25 | • SDK docs updated<br>• Internal training sessions delivered<br>• Feedback cycle incorporated into backlog | DevRel, Docs | Ensure teams can safely adopt new APIs.

## 2. Risk Register & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FFI stability issues causing runtime crashes | Medium | High | • Establish nightly fuzzing of FFI boundary<br>• Add ABI compatibility tests to CI<br>• Document supported toolchain versions | Platform Eng |
| CI cost increase due to added performance suites | High | Medium | • Tier CI workloads (smoke vs. full performance)<br>• Schedule heavy benchmarks on off-peak runners<br>• Review results weekly to tune coverage | Dev Productivity |
| Long-term maintenance burden on bindings | Medium | Medium | • Adopt shared codegen tooling<br>• Rotate maintainers quarterly<br>• Track dependency updates in release checklist | Bindings Guild |
| Knowledge silos on optimization techniques | Medium | Medium | • Pair programming rotations<br>• Internal tech talks recorded & archived<br>• Publish tuning playbooks in docs/performance | Performance Eng |

## 3. Success Metrics & Tracking

| Metric | Definition | Target | Data Source | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Performance uplift | % improvement in throughput on canonical inference suite vs. baseline release | ≥ 35% by Performance Validation exit | Benchmark harness stored in `tools/perf-runner` | Bi-weekly during validation phase |
| Developer velocity | Reduction in average integration time for new ops using bindings | ≤ 2 days turn-around by Developer Enablement exit | Jira cycle time dashboard | Monthly |
| Reliability | Mean time between incidents attributed to bindings layer | ≥ 90 days post-production | Incident management tooling | Quarterly |
| CI cost efficiency | $ per successful release candidate build | ≤ 1.2× current baseline after rollout | CI billing reports | Monthly |

**Tracking Approach**

- Centralize metrics dashboards in the internal analytics workspace with automated data pulls.
- Use the roadmap review meeting (every 4 weeks) to present deltas and decide on corrective actions.
- Document metric narratives in `docs/roadmap/status_updates/` following each review.

## 4. Stakeholder Communication Plan

- **Audience:** Product, Engineering Leadership, Operations, Developer Advocacy.
- **Artifacts:** This roadmap document, quarterly status memo, and live demo recordings.
- **Cadence:**
  - Monthly: Roadmap sync (60 min) covering milestone health, risks, and metrics trends.
  - Quarterly: Executive readout summarizing achievements, blockers, and investment asks.
  - Ad hoc: Incident reviews or major decision briefings.
- **Channels:** Slack `#spiraltorch-roadmap`, Confluence summaries, recorded Zoom sessions.
- **Ownership:** Roadmap working group maintains materials, PMO ensures distribution.

## 5. Next Steps

1. Finalize PoC scope with kernel owners by July 15.
2. Stand up nightly fuzzing pipeline by August 1.
3. Publish baseline performance dashboard by August 15.
4. Schedule first roadmap sync with stakeholders for early September.
