# SpiralTorch Roadmap Overview

This directory houses stakeholder-facing roadmap materials that describe the SpiralTorch platform evolution, cross-functional dependencies, and tracking mechanisms. Each document is maintained as a living artifact and should be updated as milestones are reached or assumptions change.

## Contents

- `roadmap.md` — Strategic milestones, risk register, and success metrics for the upcoming phases.
- `status_updates/` — (Optional) Meeting notes and quarterly readouts once the initiative enters execution.

For questions or edits, reach out to the roadmap working group via the `#spiraltorch-roadmap` Slack channel.
