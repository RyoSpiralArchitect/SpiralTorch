# SpiralReality scale entanglement memo

## 1. Minimal operators
- Treat the dilation coordinate as \(z = \log s\) so each microlocal probe is labelled by a log-scale slot. The runtime already exposes a per-radius sampler: `InterfaceGauge::analyze_with_radius` lifts a binary mask into an `InterfaceSignature` tagged by the chosen physical radius, which acts as the multiplication observable \(\hat R(z)\) in the scale Hilbert space. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L125-L141】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L250-L260】
- The orientation sector is optional and only becomes available when a labelled channel `c′` is provided. During the probe the gauge reconstructs unit normals and signed curvature whenever an oriented label is supplied, matching the role of an \(\mathcal H_{\text{ori}}\) factor that encodes \(\mathbb{RP}^{d-1}\) cosets. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L214-L247】
- Spiral dilations and rotations are generated by log-scale translations plus orientation twists. The downstream lift converts each signature into a Z-space pulse using the preferred spiral axis and a Leech projector, mirroring \(U(\tau)=\exp\!\big(\tau (\omega \hat p_z + \kappa \hat L_{\text{ori}})\big)\) acting jointly on scale and orientation. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L270-L432】

## 2. Micro–macro EPR pairing
- Multi-radius sweeps give the raw material for entangling extreme scales. `InterfaceGauge::analyze_multiradius` walks any requested list of radii, reusing the same label data, so log-separated probes \(z\) and \(-z\) can be paired into a two-mode wavefunction. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L143-L156】
- Each signature carries both gauge-invariant (unsigned) and gauge-fixed (oriented) channels. Reading the orientation-free density models the \(|z\rangle_{\text{mi}}\otimes|{-}z\rangle_{\text{ma}}\) branch, while including `c′` populates the \(|z,n\rangle\otimes|{-}z,\mathcal R_\theta n\rangle\) component with the rotation \(\mathcal R_\theta\) governed by the spiral projector. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L175-L247】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L270-L412】

## 3. Observable fingerprints
- Expectation values reduce to scale averages. Sampling \(\hat R(z)\) under a superposed state yields \(\tfrac12(R(z)+R(-z))\) plus an interference term driven by the projector-enriched drift. `InterfaceZLift::project` accumulates Above/Here/Beneath energy and emits a bias only when the oriented drift crosses the configured floor, reproducing the log-periodic beat \(\propto \cos(\Omega z)\). 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L358-L422】
- Aggregating pulses across radii retains the discrete scale signatures. `InterfaceZPulse::aggregate` support-weights multiple pulses, so a log-periodic train of radii leaves the interference comb inside the fused telemetry packet. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L434-L520】
- Each pulse now retains its physical radius and \(z=\log s\) coordinate via `ZScale`, so downstream Z-space consumers can recover the micro/macro pairing that generated the interference term. Fused pulses report the support-weighted log-scale centroid to keep scale attribution intact across smoothing. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/zpulse.rs†L52-L118】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L420-L520】

## 4. Regimes and diagnostics
- Finite correlation-length stacks decay quickly because the support requirement `min_support` and the enrichment gate suppress weak drift: interference damps after a few steps when `interface_cells` or the drift magnitude fall below the floor. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L321-L351】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L406-L415】
- Critical or discretely scale-invariant masks survive because the Above/Here/Beneath split keeps contributing, and the aggregate pulse records repeated support, exposing the expected log-periodic ladder. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L366-L420】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L478-L520】
- With `c′` active the same machinery reports "spiral polarisation": the orientation floor and axis projection ensure only co-rotating normals boost the Z bias, revealing spin–scale correlations. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L327-L351】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L369-L412】

## 5. Implementation sketch
```python
S = np.geomspace(smin, smax, M)
Rbar = np.array([R_gate_fraction(omega, s) for s in S])

z = np.log(S)
C = kernel(np.abs(z[:, None] + z[None, :]), xi_log)
phase = np.cos(Ω * (z[:, None] - z[None, :]))
R_spiral = Rbar + α * (C * phase).dot(Rbar)
mu = np.gradient(R_spiral, np.log(S))
```
The routine mirrors the microlocal sweep (`analyze_multiradius`), the spiral projection (`project`), and the fused telemetry (`InterfaceZPulse::aggregate`). 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L143-L520】

## 6. Field notes
- Gauge invariance stays intact because unsigned probes never depend on `c′`; the oriented sector is optional and guarded by the drift floor. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L214-L247】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L321-L351】
- Coarse-to-fine refinement is unitary in log-scale: radii simply translate the probe window, matching the dilation generator \(\hat p_z=-i\partial_z\). 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L125-L156】【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L358-L420】
- Telemetry layers (`SoftlogicZFeedback` consumers) read the aggregate pulse, so the log-periodic comb and spiral polarisation persist inside runtime analytics without violating the existing Z-space contracts. 【F:crates/st-core/src/theory/microlocal.rs†L416-L520】

## 7. One-line summary
Entangle the smallest and largest microlocal probes, spin them through the spiral lift, and listen for the log-scale beat plus orientation bias that the Z pulse leaves behind.
