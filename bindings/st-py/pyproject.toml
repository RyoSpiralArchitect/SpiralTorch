[tool.maturin]
# Allow invoking maturin from either the repository root (using `-m bindings/st-py/Cargo.toml`)
# or the crate directory directly.  Older maturin releases resolve `python-source`
# relative to the current working directory, which meant the default value of
# "python" only worked when the command was executed from `bindings/st-py`.
# By pointing `python-source` at the crate root and explicitly listing the
# packages that should be included we keep the packaging layout stable while
# avoiding the missing-path error the user reported.
