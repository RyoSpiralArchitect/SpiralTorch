# spiraltorch-wasm bindings

The `types/spiraltorch-wasm.d.ts` file ships hand-crafted TypeScript declarations for the
wasm-bindgen surface exposed by this crate. Copy the file next to the generated
JavaScript glue (e.g. into the `pkg/` directory produced by `wasm-pack`) and reference it
from your bundler's `types` field to enable editor completion and static checking.

## High-level Canvas utilities

`types/canvas-view.ts` implements an opinionated orchestration layer around the raw
`FractalCanvas` wasm bindings. It manages requestAnimationFrame loops, pointer-based
navigation (pan + zoom), palette overrides, and gradient statistic sampling. The helper
exposes getters and setters so UI layers can tune stats sampling, pointer navigation, and
device pixel ratios at runtime.

Add the file to your bundler entrypoint (for example by copying it next to the generated
JavaScript glue or importing it from your TypeScript project) and instantiate the helper:

```ts
import init, { FractalCanvas } from "spiraltorch-wasm";
import { SpiralCanvasView } from "./canvas-view";

await init();

const canvas = document.querySelector("#fractal") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const fractal = new FractalCanvas(64, 512, 320);
const view = new SpiralCanvasView(canvas, fractal, {
    palette: {
        stops: [
            { offset: 0, color: "#0b1026" },
            { offset: 0.5, color: "#3967ff" },
            { offset: 1, color: "#ffce69" },
        ],
        gamma: 0.8,
    },
});

view.on("stats", ({ summary }) => {
    console.log("hyper RMS", summary.hypergradRms);
});
```

The helper stays framework-agnostic so it can be wrapped inside React/Vue components or
connected to bespoke UI panels. Use the exposed `on("pointer", â€¦)` hooks to keep external
controls synchronized with the navigation state.

For teams that want a ready-to-go diagnostics HUD, `types/canvas-dashboard.ts` exposes a
vanilla DOM controller that wires `SpiralCanvasView` up to palette selectors, curvature
sliders, pointer toggles, and a stats grid:

```ts
import { FractalCanvas } from "spiraltorch-wasm";
import { SpiralCanvasView } from "./canvas-view";
import { SpiralCanvasDashboard } from "./canvas-dashboard";

const canvas = document.querySelector("#fractal") as HTMLCanvasElement;
const fractal = new FractalCanvas(64, 512, 320);
const view = new SpiralCanvasView(canvas, fractal, {
    autoStart: false,
    statsInterval: 125,
});

const hudContainer = document.querySelector("#hud") as HTMLElement;
const dashboard = new SpiralCanvasDashboard(hudContainer, view, {
    customPalettes: {
        dusk: {
            stops: [
                { offset: 0, color: "#021024" },
                { offset: 0.55, color: "#6f8dd6" },
                { offset: 1, color: "#f4bc6d" },
            ],
            gamma: 0.85,
        },
    },
});

view.start();
```

The dashboard ships lightweight glassmorphism-inspired defaults, can be embedded in any
layout, and exposes options for supplying custom palette presets or toggling controls on
and off. Since it only depends on `SpiralCanvasView`, it can be further wrapped inside
framework components as needed.
